Based on selected criteria from the following books:

* [_Site Reliability Engineering_](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) by Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff, & Niall Murphy
* [_The Site Reliability Workbook_](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/) edited by Betsy Beyer, Niall Richard Murphy, David K. Rensin, Kent Kawahara, & Stephen Thorne

Purpose: *Assess the approach to reliability and SRE practices within the software system.* 

Method: Use the [*Spotify Squad Health Check*](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/) approach to assess the team's answers to the following questions, and also capture the answers:

| **Question**                                                                                                                                                                           | **Tired (1)**                                                                    | **Inspired (5)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1\. **Service Availability** - How available (in "nines") does your service or application need to be and how do you know or decide?                                                                    | We don't know how available our service needs to be --OR-- The availability **"needs to be 100%"**.                           | The reliability is based on clear business priorities and is **less than 100%**.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2\. **User Goals and SLIs** - What should your service/application do from the viewpoint of the user?                                                                | We do not have a clear definition of what our application or service does from the user perspective.                           | We have clear, user-centric definitions of the application/service capabilities and outcomes from a user perspective.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3\. **Understanding users and behavior** - Who are the users of the software and how do they interact with the software? How do you know?                                                                                   | We don't really know how our users interact with our application/service --OR-- We don't really know who our users are.                                         | We have **user personas** validated through user research and we measure and track usage of the applications/services using digital **telemetry**.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4\. **SLIs/SLOs** - How do you **know when users have experienced an outage** or unexpected behaviour in the software?                                                    | We know there is an outage or problem when users complain via chat or the help desk.                                      | We proactively monitor the user experience using synthetic transactions across the key user journeys.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5\. **Service Health** - What is the single most important **indicator or metric** you use to determine the **health and availability of your software** in production/live?                                                          | We don't have a single key metric for the health and availability of the application/service.                   | We have a clear, agreed key metric for each application/service and we display this figure on a team-visible dashboard. The dashboard data is updated at least every 10 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6\. **SLIs** - What combination of three or four **indicators or metrics** do you use (or could/would you use) to provide a **comprehensive picture of the health and availability** of your software in production/live?                                                       | We don't have a set of key metrics for the health and availability of the application/service.                                | We have a clear, agreed set of key metrics for each application/service and we display this figure on a team-visible dashboard. The dashboard data is updated at least every 10 minutes.                                                                                                                               |
| 7\. **Error Budget and similar mechanisms** - How does the team know when to **spend time on operational aspects** of the software (logging, metrics, performance, reliability, security, etc.)? Does that time actually get spent?                                                    | We spend time on operational aspects only when there is a problem that needs fixing.                                     | We allocate between 20% and 30% of our time for working on operational aspects and we check this each week. We alert if we have not spent time on operational aspects --OR-- We use SRE Error Budgets to plan our time spent on operational aspects.                                                                              |
| 8\. **Alerting** - What proportion (approximately) of your time and effort as a team do you spend on **making alerts and operational messages more reliable and more relevant**?                                                                                       | We spend as little time as possible on alerts and operational messages - we need to focus on user-visible features.                                | We regularly spend time reviewing and improving alerts and operational messages.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 9\. **Toil and fixing problems** - What proportion (approx) of your time gets taken up with incidents from live systems and how predictable is the time needed to fix problems?                                    | We do not deal with issues from live systems at all - we focus on new features --OR-- live issues can really affect our delivery cadence and are very disruptive.                     | We allocate a consistent amount of time for dealing with live issues --OR-- one team member is responsible for triage of live issues each week OR we rarely have problems with live issues because the software works well. | 
| 10\. **Time to Diagnose** - How long does it typically take to diagnose problems in the live/production environment? This is the time taken to understand and pinpoint what is wrong (not to fix or remediate the problem).                                    | It can take hours or days to diagnose most problems in live/production.                     | It typically takes seconds or minutes to diagnose most problems in live/production. |
