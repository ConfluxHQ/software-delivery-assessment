Based on selected criteria from the following books:

* [_Site Reliability Engineering_](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) by Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff, & Niall Murphy
* [_The Site Reliability Workbook_](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/) edited by Betsy Beyer, Niall Richard Murphy, David K. Rensin, Kent Kawahara, & Stephen Thorne
* [_Team Guide to Software Operability_](http://operabilitybook.com/) by Matthew Skelton, Alex Moore, & Rob Thatcher

**Definition of on-call: for this assessment, "on-call" means being available and responsible for diagnosing and fixing (through workarounds or updated code) any problems in the live/production systems that relate to software that you and your team creates and evolves.** You might be available during working hours or outside of working hours

> **NOTE**: The subject of on-call is very emotive and there is significant context and nuance behind the assessment criteria here. **We recommend that you read at least these two articles**:
>
> 1. [On Call Shouldn’t Suck: A Guide For Managers](https://charity.wtf/2020/10/03/on-call-shouldnt-suck-a-guide-for-managers/)
> 2. [On-call doesn’t have to suck](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/on-call-b0bd8c5ea4e0)
>
> Try to understand the social context in which the criteria for _Tired_ and _Inspired_ would make sense. At one extreme, paying people 3x or 4x normal salary to be on-call could incentivize more bugs reaching the live systems (because the more problems that occur in live, the more money they get paid for being on-call); conversely, having on-call open _only_ to those people with compatible home lives could exclude many people with home care responsibilities, depriving them of valuable experience. 

Purpose: *Assess the approach to on-call support within the software system.* 

Method: Use the [*Spotify Squad Health Check*](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/) approach to assess the team's answers to the following questions, and also capture the answers:

| **Question**                                                                                                                                                                           | **Tired (1)**                                                                    | **Inspired (5)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1\. **Purpose of on-call** - How would you define "on-call"?                                                                    | On-call is a way to get developers to fix problems that people in Support or Live Services don't know how to fix.                           | On-call is a sensing mechanism to help teams build better software.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2\. **Benefits of on-call** - What are some ways in which the **software benefits** by having developers on-call?                                                                | Bugs are fixed quickly.                           | The needs of all kinds of users can be better understood by having team members on-call. We can better empathise with primary/secondary/tertiary users by seeing the problems for ourselves.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3\. **Reward** - How are you rewarded for being on-call out of working hours?                                                              | Significant compensation/money - 3x or 4x normal salary - plus additional time off. The more bugs in the software that reach live/production, the more money we make.                                        | We are recognized for our increasing skills as engineers: experience from on-call counts towards our performance reviews. We may also get some time off to recover from out-of-hours on-call and/or some additional money for out-of-hours on-call. Overall, on-call feels valuable for our careers.                |
| 4\. **On-call UX** - What is the **User Experience** (UX) / Developer Experience (DevEx) of being on-call at the moment?                                                    | It is painful and slow to diagnose problems.                                      | The tools and access rights make diagnosis exciting and an opportunity to learn.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5\. **Learning from on-call** - What happens to **knowledge gained** during on-call? How is the software improved based on on-call experiences?                                                          | Little time is allocated to fix problems after they are discovered when on-call.                   | Learning from on-call is used to prioritise key aspects of the team's work.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6\. **Attitude to on-call** - Under what circumstances would on-call not be a burden?                                                        | On-call would not be a burden if we never had to do it.                                | On-call is not a burden - it's a privilege to be able to learn how the software actually works.                                                                                                                               |
| 7\. **Future on-call** - What would be needed for this team/squad to be happy to be on-call?                                                     | We would want significant additional money/compensation.                                     | We would want a great UX/DevEx and opportunity to learn when on-call.                                                                              |
| 8\. **Tooling for on-call** - What **tooling or process is missing**, ineffective, or insufficient at the moment in relation to on-call?                                                                                        | All aspects of the on-call experience are ineffective.                                | Only very small things feel like a problem.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 9\. **Improving on-call** - How much time do you spend as a team **improving the on-call experience**? How often do you work on improvements to on-call?                                     | We don't have time to improve the on-call experience.                     | We make improvements and tweaks to on-call every week - it's continuous and part of our remit. |
| 10\. **Flexibility of on-call** - How flexible is the on-call rota or schedule? In what ways does the schedule meet the different needs of team members?                                     | Everyone must follow the same on-call schedule, including out-of-hours work.                     | Team members have flexibility to fit on-call work around their personal commitments and/or can opt to do on-call work solely during working hours (office hours). |
| 11\. **Accessibility of on-call** - How accessible is on-call? Specifically, what proportion of your team members are actually on-call regularly?                                     | Only one or two people from our team typically go on-call. Other people find on-call too difficult or confusing.                     | Everyone on our team takes part regularly in the on-call rota, whether during office ours or out-of-hours. We all share our on-call experiences and learning. |
