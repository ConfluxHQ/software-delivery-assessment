Based on the [Spotify Squad Health Check](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/) combined with insight from Google's [Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)

Purpose:  *Assess the health and confidence of the team as a delivery unit*
