Based on the operability assessment questions from [Team Guide to Software Operability](http://operabilitybook.com/) by Matthew Skelton, Alex Moore, and Rob Thatcher at [OperabilityQuestions.com](http://operabilityquestions.com/)

Purpose: *Assess the awareness and practices of the team in relation to software operability - readiness for Production*

Method: Use the [*Spotify Squad Health Check*](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/) approach to assess the team's answers to the following questions, and also capture the answers:

| **Question**                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Tired (1)**                                                                                                                          | **Inspired (5)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1\. **Collaboration** - How often and in what ways do we collaborate with other teams on operational aspects of the system such as operational features (logging, monitoring, alerting, etc.) and NFRs?   | We respond to the need for operational aspects after go-live when tickets are raised by the live service teams                         | We collaborate on operational aspects from the very first week of the engagement/project                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2\. **Spend on operability** - What proportion of product budget and team effort is spent addressing operational aspects? How do you track this? \[Ignore infrastructure costs and focus on team effort\] | We try to spend as little time and effort as possible on operational aspects / We do not track the spend on operational aspects at all | We spend around 30% of our time and budget addressing operational aspects and raise an alert if focus on operational aspects drops                                                                                                                                                                  |
